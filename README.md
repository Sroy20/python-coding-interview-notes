If you are planning to give a coding interview in Python, remembering the information presented below will be beneficial.

## Mutable, Hashable, and Iterable

**Mutable/Immutable**: In Python, some objects are mutable, meaning they can be altered.  Others are immutable; they cannot be changed but rather return new objects when attempting to update. 

The following are some immutable objects: int, float, decimal, complex, bool, string, tuple, range, frozenset, bytes

The following are some mutable objects: list, dict, set, array.array, bytearray, user-defined classes (unless specifically made immutable)

The way I like to remember which types are mutable and which are not is that containers and user-defined types tend to be mutable while scalar types are almost always immutable. Then remember some notable exceptions: tuple is an immutable container, frozenset by definition is an immutable version of set. Strings are immutable. 

It is important to understand Mutability for writing efficient codes. For example, concatenating two strings or adding a new elemnent to a tuple creates a new object and hence is memory inefficient.

**Hashable**: An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() or __cmp__() method). In addition, hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.

Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member, because these data structures use the hash value internally.

All of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable, while no mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are. Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they all compare unequal, and their hash value is their id().

## Python Data Structures

### List

General comments: The list data structure in Python is implemented as a dynamic array.

| Operation     | Example      | Time Complexity         | Notes |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Index         | l[i]         | O(1)	     | |
Store         | l[i] = 0     | O(1)	     |
Length        | len(l)       | O(1)	     |
Append        | l.append(5)  | O(1)	     |
Pop	      | l.pop()      | O(1)	     | same as l.pop(-1), popping at end
Clear         | l.clear()    | O(1)	     | similar to l = []

Slice         | l[a:b]       | O(b-a)	     | l[1:5]:O(l)/l[:]:O(len(l)-0)=O(N)
Extend        | l.extend(...)| O(len(...))   | depends only on len of extension
Construction  | list(...)    | O(len(...))   | depends on length of argument

check ==, !=  | l1 == l2     | O(N)          |
Insert        | l[a:b] = ... | O(N)	     |
Delete        | del l[i]     | O(N)	     | 
Remove        | l.remove(...)| O(N)	     | 
Containment   | x in/not in l| O(N)	     | searches list
Copy          | l.copy()     | O(N)	     | Same as l[:] which is O(N)
Pop	      | l.pop(0)     | O(N)	     | 
Extreme value | min(l)/max(l)| O(N)	     |
Reverse	      | l.reverse()  | O(N)	     |
Iteration     | for v in l:  | O(N)          |

Sort          | l.sort()     | O(N Log N)    | key/reverse doesn't change this
Multiply      | k*l          | O(k N)        | 5*l is O(N): len(l)*l is O(N**2)

Note that for i in range(...) is O(len(...)); so for i in range(1,10) is O(1).
If len(alist) is N, then

  for i in range(len(alist)):

is O(N) because it loops N times. Of course even 

  for i in range (len(alist)//2):

is O(N) because it loops N/2 times, and dropping the constant 1/2 makes
it O(N).

Finally, when comparing two lists for equality, the complexity class above shows as O(N), but in reality we would need to multiply this complexity by O(==) where O(==) is the complexity class for checking whether two values in the list are ==. If they are ints, O(==) would be O(1); if they are strings, O(==) in the worst case it would be O(len(string)). This issue applies any time an == check is done.

### Tuples
Tuples support all operations that do not mutate the data structure (and with
the same complexity classes).


### Sets
                              
Operation     | Example      | Time Complexity         | Notes
--------------+--------------+---------------+-------------------------------
Length        | len(s)       | O(1)	     |
Add           | s.add(5)     | O(1)	     |
Containment   | x in/not in s| O(1)	     | compare to list/tuple - O(N)
Remove        | s.remove(5)  | O(1)	     | compare to list/tuple - O(N)
Discard       | s.discard(5) | O(1)	     | 
Pop           | s.pop()      | O(1)	     | compare to list - O(N)
Clear         | s.clear()    | O(1)	     | similar to s = set()

Construction  | set(...)     | len(...)      |
check ==, !=  | s != t       | O(min(len(s),lent(t))
<=/<          | s <= t       | O(len(s1))    | issubset
>=/>          | s >= t       | O(len(s2))    | issuperset s <= t == t >= s
Union         | s | t        | O(len(s)+len(t))
Intersection  | s & t        | O(min(len(s),lent(t))
Difference    | s - t        | O(len(t))     |
Symmetric Diff| s ^ t        | O(len(s))     |

Iteration     | for v in s:  | O(N)          |
Copy          | s.copy()     | O(N)	     |

Sets have many more operations that are O(1) compared with lists and tuples. Not needing to keep values in a specific order (which lists/tuples require) allows for faster operations.

Frozen sets support all operations that do not mutate the data structure (and with the same complexity classes).


### Dictionaries: dict and defaultdict
                            
Operation     | Example      | Time Complexity         | Notes
--------------+--------------+---------------+-------------------------------
Index         | d[k]         | O(1)	     |
Store         | d[k] = v     | O(1)	     |
Length        | len(d)       | O(1)	     |
Delete        | del d[k]     | O(1)	     |
get/setdefault| d.method     | O(1)	     |
Pop           | d.pop(k)     | O(1)	     |
Pop item      | d.popitem()  | O(1)	     |
Clear         | d.clear()    | O(1)	     | similar to s = {} or = dict()
Views         | d.keys()     | O(1)	     |

Construction  | dict(...)    | len(...)      |

Iteration     | for k in d:  | O(N)          | all forms: keys, values, items

So, most dict operations are O(1).

defaultdicts support all operations that dicts support, with the same complexity classes (because it inherits all the operations); this assumes that calling the constructor when a values isn't found in the defaultdict is O(1) - which is true for int(), list(), set(), ... (the things commonly used)
